By converting 32-bit floating-point numbers (the `float32` data type) into lower-precision formats, like 8-bit integers (the `int8` data type), we can reduce the computational requirements of our models. Let's start with the basics and gradually move towards quantizing complex models like CNNs.\n",

    "Here is a summary of the details and a comparison with the original model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Tensor Values`: In the quantized model, these are quantized values of the weights and biases, compared to the original model which stores these in floating point precision. These values are used in the computations performed by the layer, and they directly affect the layer's output.\n",
    "- `Size`: This is the shape of the weight or bias tensor and it should be the same in both the original and quantized model. In a fully-connected layer, this corresponds to the number of neurons in the current layer and the number of neurons in the previous layer.\n",
    "- `Dtype`: In the original model, the data type of the tensor values is usually torch.float32 (32-bit floating point), whereas in the quantized model it is a quantized data type like torch.qint8 (8-bit quantized integer). This reduces the memory usage and computational requirements of the model.\n",
    "- `Quantization_scheme`: This is specific to the quantized model. It is the type of quantization used, for example, torch.per_channel_affine means different channels (e.g., neurons in a layer) can have different scale and zero_point values.\n",
    "- `Scale & Zero Point`: These are parameters of the quantization process and are specific to the quantized model. They are used to convert between the quantized and dequantized forms of the tensor values.\n",
    "- `Axis`: This indicates the dimension along which the quantization parameters vary. This is also specific to the quantized model.\n",
    "- `Requires_grad`: This indicates whether the tensor is a model parameter that is updated during training. It should be the same in both the original and quantized models."
